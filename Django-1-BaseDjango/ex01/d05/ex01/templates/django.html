            <h2>Introduction to Django</h2>
            <p>Django is a high-level Python web framework that allows developers to quickly build robust web applications. It was designed to encourage rapid development, clean, pragmatic design, and a focus on automating as much as possible to free up time for more important work, like coding the logic of your web applications.</p>

            <p>It follows the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle, allowing for reusability of code and reducing redundancy, making Django one of the most efficient frameworks for building scalable and maintainable web applications.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>A Brief History of Django</h2>
            <p>Django was created in 2003 by a team of developers working at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper in Kansas, USA. The framework was originally developed to meet the fast-paced demands of the newsroom, where deadlines were tight and developers needed a tool that could allow them to create complex web applications quickly and efficiently.</p>

            <p>The framework was open-sourced under a BSD license in July 2005, and since then, it has become one of the most popular Python frameworks for web development. Django's popularity soared due to its "batteries-included" philosophy, offering a rich set of features like user authentication, an admin interface, and URL routing right out of the box.</p>

            <p>Over the years, Django has grown to be a powerful and mature web framework with a large, active community. It is now widely used in industries ranging from startups to large enterprises, including companies like Instagram, Pinterest, and Disqus, making it a reliable choice for developers across the world.</p>
